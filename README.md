# UnityEventHandlingDemo
<strong>This small Unity C# project should help those who wish to dispatch/recieve events in the following ways:</strong>

- Using Delegate Events
- Using Delegate Events with data

- Using BroadcastMessage (similar to SendMessage and SendMessageUpwards) For API see: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component.html)

Setup/download:

1. Open this project
2. Each object on stage Object A, B and C have scripts A, B and C attached. Open the scripts to see how events are recieved.
3. Select the Main Camera, this object has a script called EventManager which for this demo dispatches events in three different ways (as explained above)
4. To run the demo, press play where you should see console logs illustrating how you can use these methods to more interesting and cool things within Unity : ) Happy Coding !
